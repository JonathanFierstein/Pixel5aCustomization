# Pixel 5a Customization

Information and data collected by Jonathan Fierstein



## Introduction

This repository is meant to be a collection of information on how to properly and successfully customize a Google Pixel 5a.  Some of the scripts provided will be mine, but most of the information and files presented were created by others, who will be properly credited for their work.   The majority, although not all, of the information, will come from XDA Developers because it is usually just not necessary to go anywhere else to get the complete picture of how to customize a particular phone.   I have been doing this successfully with a large number of phones for many years and I have never been led to brickdom by the contributors on XDA.   That's not to say that someone has not made an error once or twice; The information was almost immediately corrected and confirmed by others at XDA.  It was proven to me long ago that there is no better place for someone who wants to root and customize the OS on their new Android phone but does not possess all the requisite knowledge necessary to do so by themselves to go.
