# Pixel5aCustomization
This repo will contain customization experience on my Pixel5a.  I will keep notes, reference, and all the files I've used during the process so if someone asks me how I bricked my phone, I can just send them here instead of having to explain it.    But seriously, if someone else wants assistance, then all the information they need will be here.  XDA Developers is usually the first, last, and best source for this info.   My only frustration with that website is sometimes when I have needed files there months after the info was posted, the links to the files are no longer available.   That is the primary reason for me creating a repository to house this stuff.  Sources for info/files will be listed as appropriate.
