## Introduction

When I purchased my Pixel 5a a year ago, I created this repository to track what I did to root the phone and get a custom recovery installed and then to install Lineage or whatever I ended up deciding to put on it.   Unfortunately, I was so excited hacking my new phone that I completely forgot to take notes on the process.  By the time I was finished, I wasn’t 100% sure which steps I took at part of the process and I didn’t want to put a procedure here and then make a mistake and give everyone a procedure for how to brick their phone.   Well, after just over a year, I cracked my screen and ordered a replacement from assurance.   This time, I will take very careful notes.    Better late than never :)
